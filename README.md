# White Noise Generator aka Be in the zone

To create a tool for a distraction free environment for productivity purposes.
I generally use https://asoftmurmur.com/, but just wanted to trim it down to what I needed.

Since I've also been fiddling around a lot with web audio API lately, I thought why not.
This is just a sidetracked tiny thing that I built en route to something else.
My idea was also to make something with pure HTML/CSS/JS without any libraries.
But yeah, it is a pain after getting used to the REACT way of doing things.
